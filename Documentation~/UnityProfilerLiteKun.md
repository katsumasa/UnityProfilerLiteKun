In order to have effective performance tuning, constantly record the profile first since you can perform Profiling without limit on the number of Frames being used(as long as the memory allows).
Whenever you detect screen with poor performance, use Profling in UnityProfiler 
This Editor extention is inteded to be used in combination with [UnityChoseKun](https://github.com/katsumasa/UnityChoseKun)
When Stats is enabled, the number of frames will be displayed on the screen, so if you record the screen with UnityChoseKun, it will be easier to find out which screen has poor performance.
